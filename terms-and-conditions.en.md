Any such updates will be communicated to you through the methods outlined in the "Changes to Terms" section of these Terms. It is important to review these updates to stay informed about any changes that may affect your use of our Services.

## 14. Miscellaneous

### 14.1 Severability
In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions. The remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal, and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the provision shall be deemed severed from these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining provisions shall be interpreted and enforced as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision had never been included.

### 14.2 Assignment
We reserve the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any or all of our rights and obligations under these Terms and Conditions to any third party at our sole discretion, without any notice or consent required from you. This means that we may transfer our contractual rights and responsibilities to another entity, such as in the case of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. On the other hand, you, as a user of our Services, are not permitted to assign, transfer, or delegate any of your rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment, transfer, or delegation by you without such consent shall be null and void and of no legal effect.
### 14.3 Force Majeure
We shall not be held liable for any failure or delay in the performance of our obligations under these Terms if such failure or delay is caused by events beyond our reasonable control. These events include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, acts of God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, government actions, labor strikes, pandemics, and any other unforeseen circumstances that prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. In such cases, our obligations will be suspended for the duration of the event, and we will make reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as possible.
